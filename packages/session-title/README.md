# Session title (@dshx/session-title)

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

One small tool for the dsh sidebar: **titles you can read at a glance** — which day, what kind of work, what it was about.

- **Automatic titles** — every title becomes `0913｜排查｜登录失败`: which day, what kind of work, and what it was about, summarized from the **whole conversation** by a model (two Chinese characters for Chinese, one word for English)

## Install

In DSH Desktop profile:

```bash
node scripts/check/verify-desktop-install.mjs session-title
```

## Automatic titles

### What a title looks like

By default dsh uses a sentence the model happened to produce (for example 「确认当前模型身份及工具查询」); with a dozen sessions on screen you cannot tell which day a session belongs to or what kind of work it was. This plugin turns the title into three parts:

```
MMDD ｜ type ｜ topic
0913 ｜ 排查 ｜ DeepSeek-Harness login failure
```

- **Date** — the day the session was **created**, four digits `MMDD` (your machine's **local** time zone, so no off-by-one day around midnight). It **does not drift when the title is recomputed**: keep chatting past midnight, or run `/retitle` later, and the prefix still shows the day this conversation started
- **Type** — what the session is about, **following the generation language setting**: `zh` gets two Chinese characters (排查 / 生成 / 配置…), `en` gets a single word (Debug / Config / Docs)
- **Topic** — a summary of the **whole conversation**, not the first few characters of the first message

The format is yours to change; the default template is `{MMDD}｜{type}｜{topic}`:

| Placeholder | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `{YYYY}` `{MM}` `{DD}` `{HH}` `{mm}` `{ss}` | Date/time parts, **local time zone**, all taken from the **session creation moment**; freely combinable (`{YYYYMMDD}`, `{HHmmss}`) |
| `{type}` | Type. **Omit it and there is no type**; when it renders empty the whole segment disappears and the neighbouring separator goes with it |
| `{topic}` | Topic. **Omit it and there is no topic**; it disappears the same way when empty |

Change the template directly, e.g. `{topic}｜{MMDD}` (topic first) or `{YYYYMMDD} {topic}` (with the year).

### When it updates

- **On the first message** — dsh schedules this itself and produces a first title
- **Every 10 messages afterwards** (configurable) — this plugin triggers one recompute; the other turns never call the model
- Only top-level sessions are handled; forked child sessions are not auto-named

Each recompute sends only "first message + last main line + last summary + the new turns" — a few hundred tokens in total, **no matter how long the conversation has been going** (earlier text is only ever compressed forward, never re-sent).

The model follows the session's current main model by default; you can also pick one in the settings.

Failures behave differently depending on what already exists:

- **A title already exists**: timeouts, errors, and a missing route all **keep the previous title** — a good title is never wiped out
- **No title yet** (the very first attempt failed): instead of waiting for the model, the plugin builds a fallback title locally — the date as usual, **no type**, and the topic taken from the **leading words** of the first message (the same rule dsh uses for its own first-prompt naming: the first 8 whitespace-separated words, then a byte cap; Chinese has no spaces, so for Chinese this is effectively the whole message cut by bytes), e.g. `0915｜login failure reason`. The next recompute replaces it as soon as the model works

**Type, topic and main line** all use the plugin's **generation language** (default `zh`), regardless of interface or conversation language. Selecting `en` generates English titles even for Chinese conversations. It applies to the next generation after saving; use `/retitle` to regenerate an existing title. Local fallback titles use the original message text without translation.

### Manual recompute and rename

![The button next to the title, with its tooltip](docs/images/retitle-button.png)

**Click the header button**: the first item to the right of the title is a pencil icon; it opens a "Rename session" card — the input is prefilled with the current title and can be edited by hand; "Generate" really computes a title and **only fills the input**; "Save" writes it and locks it (no further automatic updates), and the lock switch in the bottom-left corner releases it at any time.

**Type a command**: enter `/retitle` in the input box.

> Automatic naming only fires for "a top-level session, the first human message, and no title yet", so later renames can only use the two entry points above. The three-dot menu on each session row (rename / fork / archive) is a closed platform component with no extension slot, so a third-party plugin cannot add menu items to it.

### Title display width

dsh renders the title as the last breadcrumb segment, and the upstream stylesheet hard-codes `max-width:220px` for it — after padding and the `MMDD｜type` prefix, only seven or eight Chinese characters are left for the topic. When the client activates, this plugin **injects** an override rule (no configuration needed):

```css
[class*="_crumbCurrent"]{max-width:min(640px, 60vw) !important;}
```

Only the **current session's title** is widened; ancestor sessions and subagent breadcrumbs keep the original width. If upstream renames the class, the rule fails silently (no error — the title just gets short again): select the title element in DevTools and check whether `class` still contains `_crumbCurrent`.

## Configuration

### Settings UI (recommended)

![Plugin page: the configuration form under the bundle description](docs/images/config-page.png)

Since dsh 0.1.7 the settings live on the plugin's own page: open the **Plugins** view in the sidebar, find this plugin under **Installed**, and open its detail page — the configuration form sits between the description and the entry rows.

| Item | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Generation language** | Dropdown: `zh` (Chinese, default) or `en` (English); controls type, topic and main line |
| **Recompute every N messages** | Default `10`. `0` = compute once when the session is created |
| **Model for title summaries** (provider / model) | Two dropdowns on one row: pick a provider on the left (first item "follow the chat model" = empty follows the session's main model), then a model on the right — selecting a provider auto-picks its first model. Options come from providers you have configured; falls back to two text fields when the directory is unavailable |
| **Timeout** | Raise it when the model is slow (e.g. a free tier queueing) |
| **Title format** / **Title length limit** | What the three parts look like, and how long the title may get |

Edits are **staged** and written only when you press "Save"; each field marks whether it was **customized** and can be reset on its own; leaving the form discards unsaved edits.

> The UI copy is **bilingual** and follows dsh's interface language (Settings → General → Language).

### `cordis.patch.yml` in the profile

For scripted or bulk deployments:

```yaml
- id: dshx-session-title
  config:
    language: zh
    retitleEvery: 10
    template: '{MMDD}｜{type}｜{topic}'
    maxBytes: 80
```

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `language` | `zh` / `en` | `zh` | Fixed generation language for type, topic and main line |
| `retitleEvery` | number | `10` | How many human messages between title recomputes; minimum `0`; `0` = compute once when the session is created |
| `provider` | string | empty | Model provider; **must be paired with `model`**; empty follows the session's main model |
| `model` | string | empty | Model id; **must be paired with `provider`** |
| `timeoutMs` | number | `90000` | Timeout for one model call (ms) |
| `maxOutputTokens` | number | `2048` | Output token fuse; reasoning counts against it too. Not shown in the UI; reach for it here when needed |
| `maxInputBytes` | number | `4096` | Input byte cap for one call |
| `template` | string | `{MMDD}｜{type}｜{topic}` | Title format template |
| `maxBytes` | number | `80` | Total title length cap (UTF-8 bytes), minimum 20 |

> The `｜` in the default template is a full-width vertical bar (U+FF5C). A placeholder the plugin does not recognize **stays in the title verbatim** (e.g. `{date}`), so a typo in the template is obvious at a glance.
>
> ⚠️ `maxBytes` must be ≤ `maxTitleBytes` of the `session-title` row (`dsh-base` uses **80** by default); anything beyond is **silently truncated**.
>
> Precedence is `schema default → composition layer (this section) → user layer (settings UI)`: for a field you changed in the UI, editing `cordis.patch.yml` has no effect until you "Reset" it in the UI first.

## When something goes wrong

**dsh fails to start**: this plugin ships browser-side code, so a very old dsh may not be compatible. In the profile's `cordis.patch.yml`, **disable only this plugin** and dsh recovers; upgrade dsh and install again afterwards:

```yaml
- id: dshx-session-title
  disabled: true
```

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build        # builds host first, then client
npm run typecheck
```

> **`lib/` is a build artefact committed to git** — dsh loads `main` from `package.json` (`lib/index.mjs`) and never compiles TypeScript at runtime. After changing `src/` you must run `npm run build` again and commit `lib/` with it, or the change will not take effect.

Implementation details (the cost model, how v0.8.1 wires the configuration form into dsh 0.1.7's plugin-page slot, and lessons from past iterations) live in [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) — written in Chinese.

> This README has two languages: this file and [README.zh.md](README.zh.md). **Changing one means changing the other** — the copy readers actually see is the one that counts.
